      <description>Until the Apple Airtag came out a few months ago I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked into the tag tracking market. Turns out there were already quite a lot of offerings available before Apple joined the market, most notably Tile.
However, I wanted to try out the Airtag and ended up ordering a few.
This post will explore three things:
 Removing the speaker of my Airtag Using Browser APIs to scan for Airtags (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an iPhone but someone tries to stalk you this might be handy) Explore data exfiltration via Airtags and Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Find My&amp;rdquo; network  By the way, when you order your Airtags online you can customize them.</description>
