                <h1>Lyrebird - Hack the hacker (and take a picture)</h1>
            </header>

            <p>The idea for Lyrebird came from observing that sometimes when someone forgets lock their workstation, someone else might mess with their computer. Since I wanted to learn more on how to program a webcam and take pictures - I figured why not create a little tool that takes a screenshot and uses the webcam to take pictures of anyone that interacts with the computer while I'm gone.
            </p>
            
            <p>The way this work is simple, start Lyrebird. 
                It will take a screenshot of the current desktop and then enter its observation mode. <p><i>Note: the machine is really not locked at this point. So this is not secure in anyway and you should not leave your workstation unattended without locking. </p>
                </i>
                
            <p>But anyhow, so then you can sneak away and when a malicous hacker in the office comes along and wants to interact with the desktop (the screenshot capture of it) Lyrebird will kick in and take a picture of the mysterious hacker, and then lock the workstation. I tried this a few times and it was really fun to watch! haha.</p>
            <p>Have fun! This should work on both Mac and Windows. But there might be bugs, it was just a quick prototype.</p>
         
            <p>Again, this is pure experimentation and not meant to provide any actual security besides some educational "hack the hacker' value in a controlled environment. Ideally this would be implemented as a screensaver, but it's just a quick prototype to hack the hacker. :)</p>
            So, always lock your workstation. :)
