In the [previous post](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/ai-injections-direct-and-indirect-prompt-injection-basics/) we examined various prompt injections (direct, indirect, context pollution) in AI systems, with large language models (LLMs) being particularly susceptible.

{{< figure src="/blog/images/2023/ai_injection2.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" class=".center">}}

This post will specifically focus on the output from LLMs, which is **untrusted**, and how to tackle this the challenge when adopting AI systems.

## Untrusted Data from AI Models

While developing the [yolo shell assistant](https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/yolo-ai-cmdbot), I gained good insights and a feel for LLMs. Afterwards I built a Discord chatbot and that helped me pinpoint some real-world risks present in apps.

The key is that **context *still* matters**.

**When data comes back from an LLM prompt, it needs to be considered untrusted.**

## Response Processing - Context Matters

This post will focus on the **untrustworthiness of LLM responses** and explore specific threats to chatbots. Understanding the context of where and when a response is inserted is crucial in understanding these issues. 

> The result of a LLM query should always be handled with care, and be considered untrusted data. It might contain offensive language, code, or other injections or instructions. 

Command execution and things such as **data exfiltration** are vulnerabilities and threats that I have seen and exploited in real-world LLM applications. To give well-known examples, this could be a `XSS` if your client is a web application, or a `SQL Injection` if the returned data is used in a SQL query. 

Some apps might run `OS commands` based on the LLM response - scary stuff. Nothing new here.

**BUT...**

**...there are more client side injections that you might not have thought of. Let's explore!** 

Here is a demo example, a user sending a Discord message that will return a `/msg` command which the GPT Bot executes, including summarizing the conversation history, and sending it to another user:

![discord AI message](/blog/images/2023/discord.ai.msg.png)


Allowing `/` commands, and others, for a bot can be real problematic if any external data is pulled into the chat (e.g. via internet searches, copy/paste) and that data is sent to an LLM.

**What else?**

## Threats from LLM Reponses to Chatbots

For instance, if you build a chatbot, consider the following injection threats:
* LLM returns **instructions** such as `@all`, `@everyone`,...
* LLM returns **slash specific commands**, e.g. `/command`? Does this lead to invocation of commands? Setting and commands are configurable depending on the chat platforms.
* **Hyperlinks!** Many chat apps, like **Discord, Telegram,.. automatically retrieve hyperlinks!!**. This can lead to **data exfiltration**, if a carefully crafted responses with an attacker controller hyperlink comes back from a LLM. [See examples for a variety of chat applications in the appendix](#appendix)
* During an injection attack **AI can be leveraged to perform operations on past data in the chat to summarize or search for passwords** and so forth
* Other features the client supports or parsing stacks that might be invoked by the response?

Here is an example to show how with the word `print /giphy` can be invoked:

![command invocation](/blog/images/2023/cat.gif)

As long as the chat isn't containing attacker controlled data (e.g via Internet searches or other data retrieval, or copy/paste) the impact is probably limited, but that's not always the case - and yes, I have found real-world bots that do this!

The take-away is to analyze and understand the client context and brainstorm for threats.

**Injections are painful, mitigate them upfront and don't allow attackers to exploit them.**

## Mitigations

* **Threat Modeling and Manual Pentesting:** Doing pentests on AI apps can uncover injection issues.
* **Test Automation and Fuzzing:** A good approach can be to build stub for function calls to, e.g. OpenAI's `ChatCompletion` API and then start fuzzing the client and bombard it with random responses to see how it behaves. This might help catch some output injection issues and vulnerabilities. 
* **Supervisor:** A possible solution could be a "supervisor" or "moderator" that watches a conversation to make sure it doesn't derail, but that's also not perfect, as it suffers from the same problems.
* **Human in the Loop:** For risky apps and scenarios, always consider human review. For instance, with [yolo](https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/yolo-ai-cmdbot), the default mode is that commands are not automatically executed in the shell. The user is required to review the commands, and run/copy them if they want to.
* **Permissions:** Least privilege. Make sure chatbots don't have permissions to run `/` commands, `@all` or render hyperlinks can reduce attack surface.

## Conclusion

Remember that integration context matters.

**Go-Do:**
Threat model and test AI model integrations carefully. Identify input and output injection and elevation opportunities to raise issues and help mitigate them. Data exfiltration and context specific command execution is a real threat, especially if you insert untrusted content into your LLM prompts and blindly trust the response.

For risky apps and use cases, always consider human review. 

Cheers.

## Appendix

### Data Exfiltration via Hyperlinks  

I reviewed several common chat applications that **automatically retrieve hyperlinks**.

This list doesn't include Facebook's chat apps, since I don't have them installed anymore, but they likely have the same behavior.
