      <description>Playing around with Bing Chat is quite fun. Until today I mostly used ChatGPT and GPT-4 directly, but I was curious of the capabilites and restrictions of Bing Chat.
I noticed that as soon as I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo;, Bing Chat became quite &amp;ldquo;uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;. For instance, when I asked it to imagine being a hacker and list some security vulnerabilities, it replied:
Iâ€™m sorry but I cannot help you with that.</description>

      <description>Once in a while I go build some fun new tools to adopt new tech. Just last week OpenAI made their gpt-3.5-turbo model accessible via API endpoints.
Update: The latest version also supports GPT-4.
So, I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time to start building a tool to leverage it.
What is yolo? Do you know those moments when you can&amp;rsquo;t remember a shell command, or some arguments to it? How do you pipe all errors to /dev/null again?</description>

      <title>ChatGPT: Imagine you are a database server</title>

      <description>After reading this post about ChatGPT imitating Linux, I wanted it to be a database server.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try it out!
 Imagine you are a Microsoft SQL Server. I type commands, and you reply with the result, and no other information or descriptions. Just the result. Start with exec xp_cmdshell &amp;lsquo;whoami&amp;rsquo;;
 
Wow, this looks like a promising start.
And, it &amp;ldquo;thinks&amp;rdquo; that it is running as LOCAL SYSTEM - quite funny actually.</description>
