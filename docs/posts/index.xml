      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.
The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.

The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.
In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>

      <title>Backdoor users on Linux with uid=0</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/linux-user-uid-zero-backdoor/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/linux-user-uid-zero-backdoor/</guid>
      <description>On Unix/Linux users with a uid=0 are root. This means any security checks are bypassed for them.
An adversary might go ahead and create a new account, or set an existing account&amp;rsquo;s user identifier (uid) or group identifier to zero.
A simple way to do this is to update /etc/passwd of an account, or use usermod -u 0 -o mallory.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a new user named mallory:

      <description>This post is part of the machine learning attack series.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I did a Husky AI and offensive machine learning related post. This weekend I had some time to try out Counterfit. My goal was to understand what Counterfit is, how it works, and use it to turn Shadowbunny into a husky.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
What is Counterfit? With Counterfit you can test your machine learning models and endpoints for specific adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Using procdump on Linux to dump credentials</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/linux-procdump/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/linux-procdump/</guid>
      <description>I like using procdump on Windows.
It’s quite handy for software development when systems have memory leaks or performance issues, procdump allows to set thresholds to trigger creation of a core dump.
BUT, it’s also super useful to search processes for secrets and other information.
For instance, this one liner will dump the memory of all processes to hard disk and then you can search them as you see fit.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/silversearcher-ag/</guid>
      <description>In this very short post I wanna talk mention The Silver Searcher, which I just learned about a few weeks ago.
In the past I have written quite a bit about the importance of credential hunting for your organization and some cool built-in operating system indexing features that can be used as well.
Of course grep and findstr are also in every red teamers toolbox.
As part of a coding project I recently learned about &amp;ldquo;The Silver Searcher&amp;rdquo;, which is very fast and has some neat features built it.</description>

      <description>Many Windows applications and services are implemented using an automation infrastructure called Component Object Model (COM).
COM has been around for decades and its useful for programming, sharing of code at binary level, usage from scripting languages, and well, red teaming.
Wide Usage of Component Object Model Many products are implemented as COM objects, including Microsoft Office. Using PowerShell (or other languages) COM objects can be created to fully automate applications and services.</description>

      <description>Until the Apple Airtag came out a few months ago I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked into the tag tracking market. Turns out there were already quite a lot of offerings available before Apple joined the market, most notably Tile.
However, I wanted to try out the Airtag and ended up ordering a few.
This post will explore three things:
 Removing the speaker of my Airtag Using Browser APIs to scan for Airtags (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an iPhone but someone tries to stalk you this might be handy) Explore data exfiltration via Airtags and Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Find My&amp;rdquo; network  By the way, when you order your Airtags online you can customize them.</description>

      <description>This rather lengthy post goes into reasons for having an offensive security program and in particular, on how a red team can help improve the immune system of your organization. This is the high-level outline of the post:
 Security breaches cannot be entirely prevented Implications of a breach Automated malware can hit your organization at any time Security investments - run as fast as you can, just to stay in place The immune system of your organization Embracing the red  With regular cadence companies are compromised and suffer breaches.</description>

      <description>Recently Google&amp;rsquo;s FLoC proposal has been making the rounds in the news. FLoC stands for &amp;ldquo;federated learning of cohorts&amp;rdquo; and is Google&amp;rsquo;s vision how to perform user profiling in Chrome going forward.
Currently user tracking and profiling happens (mostly) via cookies, but many browser vendors have been supportive of protection of their users and started blocking third party and tracking cookies - or at least offer features in their browser to enable blocking.</description>

      <title>Spoofing credential dialogs on macOS, Linux and Windows</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/spoofing-credential-dialogs/</guid>
      <description>A nifty way for adversaries to acquire passwords during post-exploitation is to spoof credential dialogs and perform a local phishing attack. This means tricking a user on a compromised computer to enter their password.
Unfortunately, users are conditioned to enter their credentials frequently and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t question random passwords prompts too much.
Long, long time ago&amp;hellip; but nothing has changed The idea to spoof a credential dialog is one of the most simple ideas one might come up with.</description>

      <description>You probably heard of NFTs (non-fungible tokens). They are receiving a lot of interest over the last several months. I did some digging and realized that there are some bigger issues with the standards and various interpretations and implementations of it, and how centralized many offerings are.
What is an NFT The idea behind it is simple, use a blockchain (and cryptography) to assign and be able to proof ownership over a specific piece of digital content.</description>

      <description>Next week (on March, 9th 2021) I will be speaking at the Hong Kong Information Security Summit 2021.
歡迎, 你好!

I was invited to share my thoughts around protecting the modern (and remote) workplace. Of course, my talk is addressing this topic from a red teaming point of view. Conference details are here.
The adversary will come to your house The name of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Red Team Strategies for Helping Protect the Modern Workplace&amp;rdquo; which might seem less creative, but there is some (hopefullly) good and interesting information in my talk.</description>

      <description>The other day I read this blog post about &amp;ldquo;The Death of Manual Red Teams&amp;rdquo; and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a moment to comment on it to provide an alternative perspective.
In my opinion the premise of the blog post is backwards, highlighting a lack of understanding of what red teaming is about.
For instance the following sentence in the post seems quite incorrect: &amp;ldquo;Red teaming is the process of using existing, already known security bugs and vulnerabilities to hack a system.</description>

      <description>The other day Microsoft published a great deep dive around the second stage payloads and hands-on hacking activities of the Solarwinds/Sunburst incidents that where uncovered late 2020.
One thing that is so interesting is the use of off the shelve Cobalt Strike tooling and templates for command &amp;amp; control. After doing all the hard work and customization to seamlessly backdoor binaries the adversaries sem to use Cobalt Strike.
Intel for Red Teamers Although, they did add customizations with some interesting features, which are interesting for red teamers to be aware of.</description>

      <description>Survivorship bias is an interesting thing that we can observe nearly daily. It is the success stories of exponentially growing startups, the motivational speaker who shares their insights on how to be successful and so forth.
What is it exactly?
What is survivorship bias? Wikipedia defines it as &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/gamifying-red-team-security-score/</guid>
      <description>Security metrics are an interesting topic.
Over the years I used &amp;ldquo;scores&amp;rdquo; as a tool to identify and shine light on problematic areas or highlight lack of engineering and security quality of certain teams.

A security score should not seen as an objective or absoulte measure, but it allows to compare systems with each other at a relative scale, and by sharing the score it makes people ask questions.</description>

      <description>Today FireEye shared that they were victim of a cyberattack and internal red teaming tooling was accessed by adversaries. More details in this NYT article.
This reminded me that I wanted to do a post on actively protecting pen testers and pen testing assets for a while.
Against persistent adversaries it is only a matter of time when they succeed, not if they will succeed. The big question is do you know when an adversary starts poking around, and when they succeed?</description>

      <description>What a journey it has been. I wrote quite a bit about machine learning from a red teaming/security testing perspective this year. It was brought to my attention to provide a conveninent &amp;ldquo;index page&amp;rdquo; with all Husky AI and related blog posts. Here it is.

Here are a few examples on AI/ML gone wrong:
 Amazon had an AI recruiting tool which favored men over women for technical jobs The Microsoft chat bot named &amp;ldquo;Tay&amp;rdquo; which turned racist and sexist rather quickly A doctor at the Jupiter Hospital in Florida referred to IBM&amp;rsquo;s AI system for helping recommend cancer treatments as &amp;ldquo;a piece of sh*t&amp;rdquo; Facebook&amp;rsquo;s AI got someone arrested for incorrectly translating text  The list of AI failures goes on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>You might have heard about &amp;ldquo;NAT Slipstreaming&amp;rdquo; by Samy Kamkar. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.
The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.
What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.
That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.
 Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!
 Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>

      <description>For GrayHat 2020 I was asked to create a short intro video for my Red Team Village talk &amp;ldquo;Learning by doing: Building and breaking a machine learning system&amp;rdquo;.
So I put my green screen to good use and recorded this short clip for Red Team Village.
Here is the link to the clip on Twitter:

Hope you like it. :)
The talk will be October, 31st 2020.

      <description>There is a lot of discussion around terms such as red team, attack team, pentest, adversarial engineering or offensive security team and similar ones.
I typically stay away from the (sometimes passionate) discussions that ensue whenever this topic comes up.
Personally, I think a good strategy is to define programs and teams who operate in this space by what services the team (or teams) provide(s) to the organization.
The business groups, blue team, developers, engineers, employees and clients are the customers.</description>

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.
When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.
So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

The origins of the Shadowbunny A few years ago, around 2016, I went on a relaxing two weeklong vacation. It was great to disconnect from work. I traveled to Austria, enjoying hiking in the mountains, and exploring Vienna.
When I came back to the office, the team had placed a giant bunny teddy into my chair.</description>

I wrote about my journey before - including what classes I took and books I read, the models and systems I built and operationalized, threat modeling it to learn about practical attacks and defenses. My goal is to be knowledge enough in the AI/ML space enough to be able to help bridge the gap between research and operational red teaming - by doing practical things with life systems.</description>

Race conditions can allow an adversary to gain access to sensitive information on machines. Assume a system creates a file that contains sensitive information and afterwards applies permissions to lockdown that file.
Understanding the race condition Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a practical example seen in the wild a few times.</description>

Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.
Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>

      <description>Throughout my career I have been fascinated with quality assurance and testing, especially security testing and red teaming. One discussion that comes up frequently is how to measure the maturity of such programs and processes.
My answer is straight forward as there are already existing frameworks that can be leveraged, adjusted and borrowed from to fit the needs of offensive security programs.
You are likely familiar or have at least heard of the Capability Maturity Model Integration from Carnegie Mellon University.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/firefox-cookie-debug-client/</guid>
      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.
It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.

This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.
These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.
What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/windows-port-forward/</guid>
      <description>A technique on Windows that is less known is how to do basic port-proxying.
Proxying ports is useful when a process binds on one (maybe only the local) interface and you want to expose that endpoint on another network interface.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an existing process that listens only on the loopback interface, and you want to expose it remotely. Or there are two network interfaces and you want expose traffic from one to the other (maybe some evil persistence for port 3389) - or think of basic pivoting.</description>

      <description>A few months ago we discussed the importance of performing active credential hunting for your organization.
This is to ensure clear text credentials in widely accessible locations and source code are identified before an adversary gets a hold of them.

      <description>The Shadowbunny TTP in the PenTest Magazine The latest edition of the PenTest Magazine features an article of mine about using virtual machines (VMs) during lateral movement to establish persistence and evade detections.
A few years back when I came up with the idea of using VMs for lateral movement during red teaming, I called it the Shadowbunny TTP and that name stuck around in my head. There is more info in the article around the origin of the name also.</description>

      <title>Putting system owners in Security Bug Jail</title>

      <description>Some organization have this interesting concept of a bug jail to prevent new feature development when there are too many existing flaws in the system.
For instance, if an engineer has 5 or more bugs assigned they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to work on anything else but fixing their bugs.
What is the Security Bug Jail? A security bug jail goes along the same lines. The owner of a system can never have more than a certain upper limit of active security bugs.</description>

      <title>Red Teaming and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/red-teaming-and-monte-carlo-simulations/</guid>
      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.
Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.
Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>

      <title>Phishing metrics - what to track?</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/phishing-stats/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/phishing-stats/</guid>
      <description>The results of phishing campaigns are often not comparable with each other over time. Various security vendors and red teams use different tooling and techniques - which is totally fine.
However, I recommend requiring tracking a minimum set of metrics to be able to compare results over time.
Funny side facts: At times employees are messing with the red team, entering invalid creds for CISO or CEO and things along those lines.</description>

      <description>Last month I did some research on Firefox, specifically I was learning more about it&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging features. As part of that I was reading Bugzilla bug information and learned more about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.
One thing I noticed reading up on details was that Mozilla uses Phabricator.
What is Phabricator? Phabricator is a collaborative web-based toolset for code reviews, checkins, bugs, work items, wiki, pastes, credentials and many other useful things.</description>

      <description>Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 @mangopdf described &amp;ldquo;Cookie Crimes&amp;rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.
The original research is published here, and it still works today.
The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Post-Exploitation: Abusing Chrome&#39;s debugging feature to observe and control browsing sessions remotely</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/chrome-spy-remote-control/</guid>
      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.
However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.
Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <title>Hunting for credentials and building a credential type reference catalog</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/hunting-for-credentials/</guid>
      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.
At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.
Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

      <description>Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &amp;ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&amp;rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.
In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a graphic designer, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are better ways of doing this.</description>

      <description>Announcement After countless evenings and weekends in coffee shops, and multiple vacations with the laptop, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that my first book has been published. It took 18 months from writing the first words (at Victrola Coffee Roasters on Capitol Hill by the way) to finishing this project just a few days ago.

Looking back its amazing how this all came together. The first intial draft had 100 pages, and in the end it ended up being 524 pages.</description>

      <description>Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie&amp;rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!</description>

      <description>Final Year Project - Web Application Security Principles About 18 years ago I worked on the final year project for my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I had just gotten interested in security and was learning about security principles.
The title of the project was &amp;ldquo;Web Application Security Principles - Designing Secure Web Based Enterprise Solutions&amp;rdquo;.
Looking back, a really cool thing was that I had just started working at Microsoft as an Associate Development Consultant and was bold enough to send the paper last minute over to Michael Howard - who responded and indeed reviewed it!</description>

      <description>This post highlights a simple mitigation to improve the security posture of your organization. The idea is to, by practical means, limit attack surface and prevent spreading of automated malware, as well as limiting lateral movement by adversaries.
Network security over the last 15 years Malware can spread fast and damage businesses at scale.
SQL Slammer [1] and WannaCry [2] are two well-known cases that showed how quickly and damaging this can be.</description>

      <description>Recently Coinbase published a well written blog post on how they were under attack. The adversaries exploite Firefox 0-days. Details can be found here. One intersting aspect is the following:
 &amp;ldquo;We have also observed the attackers specifically target cloud services, e.g. gmail and others, via browser session token theft via direct access to browser datastores. This activity also offers the opportunity for behavior-based detection, as relatively few processes should be directly accessing those files.</description>

      <description>No one should beat your security team on the homefield! For several years I have been using the term Homefield Advantage in the context of running a security program, especially in regards to certain aspects of red teaming. Homefield Advantage describes well what a mature security program has to realize and leverage.
Wikipedia describes &amp;ldquo;home advantage&amp;rdquo; in team sports and highlights some of the benefits:
 &amp;ldquo;This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/bash-spray-password/</guid>
      <description>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.
In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.
Check it out: Bash Spray
Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.</description>

If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.
 First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.</description>

      <description>The idea for Lyrebird came from observing that sometimes when someone forgets lock their workstation, someone else might mess with their computer. Since I wanted to learn more on how to program a webcam and take pictures - I figured why not create a little tool that takes a screenshot and uses the webcam to take pictures of anyone that interacts with the computer while I&amp;rsquo;m gone.
The way this work is simple, start Lyrebird.</description>

      <description>KoiPhish is a simple yet beautiful relay proxy idea.
The idea for this little project goes back many years. Since I started learning Golang I figured it would be good exercise to finally go ahead an implement it. So, last December during the 35C3 (which is always inspiring congress) I wrote it up.
It relays requests a client makes to the KoiPish to the actual target and responses are sent back to the client.</description>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.
The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
