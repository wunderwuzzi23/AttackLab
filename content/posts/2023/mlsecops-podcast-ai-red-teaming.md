**Hack and protect Machine Learning Systems so that we don't get stuck in the matrix!**

It's been almost three years since I started the [Machine Learning Attack Series](/blog/posts/2020/machine-learning-attack-series-overview/), and my interest in attacking and leveraging AI and Machine Learning is unbroken. 



There is so much to learn and explore, particularly in bridging the gap between traditional security engineering and machine learning. As followers of this blog will know, this is an area I have been exploring in-depth over the past few years.

That's why I'm thrilled to have been invited as a guest on The MLSecOps Podcast. It gave me the opportunity to share my insights on AI Red Teaming, Machine Learning Security, and Threat Modeling such systems.

I hope the interview is interesting, and insightful.

Best,
Johann.
