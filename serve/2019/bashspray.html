            <p>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.</p>
            <br>
            
            In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.

            Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.
