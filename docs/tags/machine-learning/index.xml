      <description>Happy New Year everyone!
A few weeks ago after Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q, I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.
Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem, this post highlights further details and how it was fixed.
The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can inject markdown tags, which can render hyperlinks and lead to data exfiltration.
Impact When a user processes untrusted data with Amazon Q, an adversary (via Indirect Prompt Injection) can instruct Q to render a clickable hyperlink via markdown instructions.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.
Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&#39; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.
Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/</guid>
      <description>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.
So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!
This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.
I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</description>

      <description>Large Language Model (LLM) applications and chatbots are quite commonly vulnerable to data exfiltration. In particular data exfiltration via Image Markdown Injection is frequent.
This post describes how Google Cloud&amp;rsquo;s Vertex AI - Generative AI Studio had this vulnerability that I responsibly disclosed and Google fixed.
A big shout out to the Google Security team upfront, it took 22 minutes from report submission to receiving a confirmation from Google that this is a security issue that will be fixed.</description>

      <description>Large Language Model (LLM) applications and chatbots are quite commonly vulnerable to data exfiltration. In particular data exfiltration via Image Markdown Injection is quite frequent.
Microsoft fixed such a vulnerability in Bing Chat, Anthropic fixed it in Claude, and ChatGPT has a known vulnerability as Open AI &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo; the issue.
This post describes a variant in the Azure AI Playground and how Microsoft fixed it.
From Untrusted Data to Data Exfiltration When untrusted data makes it into the LLM prompt context it can instruct the model to inject an image markdown element.</description>

      <description>During an Indirect Prompt Injection Attack an adversary can exfiltrate chat data from a user by instructing ChatGPT to render images and append information to the URL (Image Markdown Injection), or by tricking a user to click a hyperlink.
Sending large amounts of data to a third party server via URLs might seem inconvenient or limiting&amp;hellip;
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want something more, aehm, powerful, elegant and exciting.
ChatGPT Plugins and Exfiltration Limitations Plugins are an extension mechanism with little security oversight or enforced review process.</description>

      <description>What happens if an attacker calls an LLM tool or plugin recursively during an Indirect Prompt Injection? Could this be an issue and drive up costs, or DoS a system?
I tried it with ChatGPT, and it indeed works and the Chatbot enters a loop! ðŸ˜Š

However, for ChatGPT users this isn&amp;rsquo;t really a threat, because:
 It&amp;rsquo;s subscription based, so OpenAI would pay the bill. There seems to be a call limit of 10 times in a single conversation turn (I tried a few times).</description>

      <description>This video highlights the various data exfiltration vulnerabilities I discovered and responsibly disclosed to Microsoft, Anthropic, ChatGPT and Plugin Developers.
It also briefly discusses mitigations various vendors put in place (and triage decisions).
  Â Thanks to MSRC, Anthropic and Zapier for addressing vulnerabilities to help protect their users.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it inspires OpenAI to mitigate the image markdown injection issue finally as well. It&amp;rsquo;s rated as a CVSS High scored vulnerability basically and was first reported to them on April, 9th 2023 - the triage decision was &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A common attack vector that LLM apps face is data exfiltration, in particular data exfiltration via Image Markdown Injection is a common vulnerability. Microsoft fixed the vulnerability in Bing Chat, ChatGPT is still vulnerable as Open AI &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fixed&amp;rdquo; the issue, and Anthropic just mitigated this vulnerability in Claude.
This post documents the Anthropic Claude data exfiltration vulnerability and the mitigation put in place.

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.
As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.
Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.
An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A prompt injection scenario that I, and others, have been wondering about in the past, is the potential risk associated with chatbots being able to analyze images.
Could this ability open up the way for Indirect Prompt Injection attacks?
Recently, Google added the ability to uploading and analyze images with Bard. And it turns out that it is indeed possible to add instructions to an image, and have the Bard follow those instructions.</description>

Check out Google Labs for more info.
These features can be very helpful, but they also introduce new security risks.

As an example we explored how the &amp;ldquo;Chat with Code&amp;rdquo; plugin is vulnerable. Recently, a post on Reddit titled &amp;ldquo;This is scary! Posting stuff by itself&amp;rdquo; shows how a conversation with ChatGPT, out of the blue (and what appears to be by accident) created a Github Issue!</description>

      <description>OpenAI continues to add plugins with security vulnerabilities to their store.
In particular powerful plugins that can impersonate a user are not getting the required security scrutiny, or a general mitigation at the platform level.
As a brief reminder, one of the challenges Large Language Model (LLM) User-Agents, like ChatGPT, and plugins face is the Confused Deputy Problem / Plugin Request Forgery Attacks, which means that during a Prompt Injection attack an adversary can issue commands to plugins to cause harm.</description>

      <description>This post describes how I found a Prompt Injection attack angle in Bing Chat that allowed malicious text on a webpage (like a user comment or an advertisement) to exfiltrate data.
The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection When Bing Chat returns text it can return markdown elements, which the client will render as HTML. This includes the feature to include images.
Imagine the LLM returns the following text:

      <description>To help raise awareness of Indirect Prompt Injections and other related attacks, I put together a little fun mini app that you can invoke with ChatGPT.
Visit this link with GPT-4 and Browsing enabled (see Appendix, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means):
https://wuzzi.net/matrix The website will hijack ChatGPT via an indirect prompt injection and then allow you to enter the matrix, if you decide to do so.

Note: You can&amp;rsquo;t browse to the URL, it will only respond to ChatGPT.</description>

Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.
The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.
Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.
However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.
They start showing up in many places.
A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.

      <description>Playing around with Bing Chat is quite fun. Until today I mostly used ChatGPT and GPT-4 directly, but I was curious of the capabilites and restrictions of Bing Chat.
I noticed that as soon as I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo;, Bing Chat became quite &amp;ldquo;uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;. For instance, when I asked it to imagine being a hacker and list some security vulnerabilities, it replied:
Iâ€™m sorry but I cannot help you with that.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/machine-learning-attack-series-injecting-code-pickle-files/</guid>
      <description>Recently I read this excellent post by Evan Sultanik about exploiting pickle files on Trail of Bits. There was also a DefCon30 talk about backdooring pickle files by ColdwaterQ.
This got me curious to try out backdooring a pickle file myself.
Pickle files - the surprises Surprisingly Python pickle files are compiled programs running in a VM called the Pickle Machine (PM). Opcodes control the flow, and when there are opcodes there is often fun to be had.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/gpt-3-ai-and-phishing-attacks/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine how GPT-3 could be used by red teams or adversaries to perform successful phishing attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss some potential countermeasures that organizations can take to protect themselves against this type of threat.
What is GPT-3? GPT-3 is a neural network-based machine learning system that was developed by OpenAI, a research lab focused on artificial intelligence. It is designed to generate text that sounds realistic and human-like, and it has been trained on a large corpus of text, including billions of words from the internet.</description>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?
This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.

This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.

      <description>In this post we will explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images. The goal is, of course, to have &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; misclassify them as real huskies.
If you want to learn more about Husky AI visit the Overview post.
Generative Adversarial Networks One of the attacks I wanted to investigate for a while was the creation of fake images to trick Husky AI. The best approach seemed by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</description>

      <description>There are plenty of examples of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems that made it into the news because of biased predictions and failures.
Here are a few examples on AI/ML gone wrong:
 Amazon had an AI recruiting tool which favored men over women for technical jobs The Microsoft chat bot named &amp;ldquo;Tay&amp;rdquo; which turned racist and sexist rather quickly A doctor at the Jupiter Hospital in Florida referred to IBM&amp;rsquo;s AI system for helping recommend cancer treatments as &amp;ldquo;a piece of sh*t&amp;rdquo; Facebook&amp;rsquo;s AI got someone arrested for incorrectly translating text  The list of AI failures goes on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.
When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.
So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

      <description>These days business decisions and feature development often is influenced heavily by telemetry information. Telemetry is baked into the programs, services and applications we use.
Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.
Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>
