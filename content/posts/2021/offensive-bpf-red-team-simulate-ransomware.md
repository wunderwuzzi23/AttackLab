## Red Team Simulation: Ransomware Excercises

Interestingly, it might also be quite helpful for red teams to simulate Ransomware Attacks. The bpf program could not really  data but by just having BPF overwrite user data structures on the fly and show users scrambled information.

This is something I want to build - so stay tuned.
