      <title>Running Ad Campaigns during Red Teaming Engagements</title>

      <description>Running ads as part of red teaming to achieve objectivs is something I wanted to look into for a while.
It&amp;rsquo;s well [known](](https://time.com/5197255/facebook-cambridge-analytica-donald-trump-ads-data/) that state actors (both local and foreign) use this technique to manipulate voter opion.
Marketing is a red teaming tool.
Recent research from the
Selecting Victims - Ad Campaign Manager When looking at this the first time it seems surreal, and kind of gives an idea how creepy the ad business industry can be.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF to learn how BPFs use will impact offensive security, malware, and detection engineering.

Building advanced BPF programs So far in this Offensive BPF series the focus was on bpftrace to build and run BPF programs.
The next thing I wanted to investigate is what options are available to modify data structures during BPF execution.</description>

      <title>Offensive BPF: Sniffing Firefox traffic with bpftrace</title>

One of the issues I ran into when trying out sslsniff-bpfcc was that it did not work with Firefox or Chrome traffic.
This post is about me learning how to hook user space APIs with bpftrace using uprobes.</description>

      <title>Video: What is Tabnabbing?</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/what-is-tab-nabbing/</link>

      <description>Tabnabbing is a web application security vulnerability that can be used to perform phishing attacks, so its important to be aware of it as a developer and penetration tester.
It is easy to mitigate and in this short video we cover both attacks and mitigations.

Thanks for reading and happy hacking!

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to learn about BPF to understand attacks and defenses. Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all relevant posts.
In the previous posts I spend time learning about bpftrace which is quite powerful. This post is focused on basics and using existing BPF tools, rather then building new BPF programs from scratch.
Living off the land: bpfcc-tools Performance and observability teams are pushing for BPF tooling to be present in production.</description>

In the last post we talked about a basic bpftrace script to install a BPF program that runs commands upon connecting from a specific IP with a specific magic source port.
This post will dive into this idea more by leveraging more a complex solution.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m learning BPF to understand how its use will impact offensive security, malware, and detection engineering.
One offsec idea that quickly comes to mind with BPF is to observe network traffic and act upon specific events. So, I wanted to see if/how bpftrace, a popular tool for running BPF programs, can be used to create potential backdoors, and what evidence to look for as defenders.</description>

      <title>Offensive BPF! Getting started.</title>

      <description>Over the last few years eBPF has gained a lot of traction in the Linux community and beyond.
eBPF&amp;rsquo;s offensive usage is also slowly getting more attention. So, I decided to dive into the topic from a red teaming point of view to learn about it to raise awareness and share the journey.
Similar to the format of my Machine Learning Attack Series, there will be a serious of posts around BPF usage in offensive settings, and also how its misuse can be detected.</description>

      <title>Video: Web Application Security Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/web-application-security-fundamentals-video/</link>

      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.
The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.

The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.
In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>
