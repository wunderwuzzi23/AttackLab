      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. Interestingly enough, that talk was about my very first post which was the advent of the Embrace The Red blog in December 2018.
Fast forward&amp;hellip; it was great to attend 37c3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people and awesome events and side quests.</description>
