      <title>Video: Prompt Injection - An Introduction</title>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.
Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.
Bypassing input validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>Recently I got the feedback to create more tutorials and videos, and I thought SSH Agent Hijacking on Linux and macOS (which I wrote about before here) would make a good one.
The video tutorial is here.

If you like this kind of content, then comment or like the video on YouTube and I&amp;rsquo;ll create more.
Hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful to get a good basic understanding of this TTP, and help build detections for it.</description>

      <description>As more organizations move to hardware tokens and password-less auth (e.g. Yubi-keys, Windows Hello for Business,&amp;hellip;) attackers will look for other ways to to trick users to gain access to their data.
One novel phishing technique is by using the OAuth2 Device Authorization Grant.
This post describes how it works with Microsoft AAD as example.

      <description>There are some neat TTPs that I don&amp;rsquo;t use frequently, and if the time arises, I need to dig up details again. So, I figured to write some of them down, starting with SSH Agent Hijacking.
What is SSH Agent Hijacking? Short story, if you have keys added to an SSH Agent an adversary with root permissions can use them. If you forward the SSH Agent to another host, an adversary with root permission on that other host can exploit and leverage your keys as well.</description>

      <description>Information for red teaming macOS and info on real world TTPs are still a bit sparse. That makes it difficult for defenders to know what attackers do on macOS compared to Windows. Some organizations might have a bigger blind spot when it comes to macOS.
This post describes how an adversary can grab hashes from a macOS machine, how to convert it to a hashcat friendly format and use hashcat to crack it.</description>

      <description>On Unix/Linux users with a uid=0 are root. This means any security checks are bypassed for them.
An adversary might go ahead and create a new account, or set an existing account&amp;rsquo;s user identifier (uid) or group identifier to zero.
A simple way to do this is to update /etc/passwd of an account, or use usermod -u 0 -o mallory.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a new user named mallory:

      <description>Many Windows applications and services are implemented using an automation infrastructure called Component Object Model (COM).
COM has been around for decades and its useful for programming, sharing of code at binary level, usage from scripting languages, and well, red teaming.
Wide Usage of Component Object Model Many products are implemented as COM objects, including Microsoft Office. Using PowerShell (or other languages) COM objects can be created to fully automate applications and services.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/spoofing-credential-dialogs/</guid>
      <description>A nifty way for adversaries to acquire passwords during post-exploitation is to spoof credential dialogs and perform a local phishing attack. This means tricking a user on a compromised computer to enter their password.
Unfortunately, users are conditioned to enter their credentials frequently and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t question random passwords prompts too much.
Long, long time ago&amp;hellip; but nothing has changed The idea to spoof a credential dialog is one of the most simple ideas one might come up with.</description>

      <description>You might have heard about &amp;ldquo;NAT Slipstreaming&amp;rdquo; by Samy Kamkar. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.
The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.
What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.
That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.
 Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!
 Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>

      <description>This was also presented at BSides Singapore 2020. The slides are here and YouTube link is here.
The origins of the Shadowbunny A few years ago, around 2016, I went on a relaxing two weeklong vacation. It was great to disconnect from work. I traveled to Austria, enjoying hiking in the mountains, and exploring Vienna.
When I came back to the office, the team had placed a giant bunny teddy into my chair.</description>

Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.
Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>

      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.
It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.

This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.
These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.
What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/windows-port-forward/</guid>
      <description>A technique on Windows that is less known is how to do basic port-proxying.
Proxying ports is useful when a process binds on one (maybe only the local) interface and you want to expose that endpoint on another network interface.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an existing process that listens only on the loopback interface, and you want to expose it remotely. Or there are two network interfaces and you want expose traffic from one to the other (maybe some evil persistence for port 3389) - or think of basic pivoting.</description>

This is to ensure clear text credentials in widely accessible locations and source code are identified before an adversary gets a hold of them.
In this post we will explore using built-in operating system indexing features to search for information on machines quickly.
Many of us use the indexing features (like Windows Search and Spotlight) daily via the UI.</description>

      <description>Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 @mangopdf described &amp;ldquo;Cookie Crimes&amp;rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.
The original research is published here, and it still works today.
The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.
However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.

      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.
At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.
Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

      <description>Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie&amp;rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!</description>

      <description>MITRE just updated the ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework to include Cloud TTPs.
The update includes techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:
 Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie  It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the Pass the Cookie work referenced.</description>

      <description>Just a list of useful notes when dealing with Macs. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty new to Macs and there might be other, better solutions to the challenges I had to sovle but these worked for me and I&amp;rsquo;m learning. :)
Pivoting between accounts and keychain issues After pivoting on a target host and elevating to root it seems not possible to gain access to other keychains easily. It requires to know the password of the other account still.</description>

      <title>Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds</title>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.
The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
