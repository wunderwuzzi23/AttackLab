Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one? 

This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.

This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.
