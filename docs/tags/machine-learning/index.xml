      <title>Video: Understanding Image Scaling Attacks</title>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?
This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.

This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.

      <description>This post is part of the machine learning attack series.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I did a Husky AI and offensive machine learning related post. This weekend I had some time to try out Counterfit. My goal was to understand what Counterfit is, how it works, and use it to turn Shadowbunny into a husky.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
What is Counterfit? With Counterfit you can test your machine learning models and endpoints for specific adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>What a journey it has been. I wrote quite a bit about machine learning from a red teaming/security testing perspective this year. It was brought to my attention to provide a conveninent &amp;ldquo;index page&amp;rdquo; with all Husky AI and related blog posts. Here it is.

      <description>In this post we will explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images. The goal is, of course, to have &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; misclassify them as real huskies.
If you want to learn more about Husky AI visit the Overview post.
Generative Adversarial Networks One of the attacks I wanted to investigate for a while was the creation of fake images to trick Husky AI. The best approach seemed by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</description>

      <description>There are plenty of examples of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems that made it into the news because of biased predictions and failures.
Here are a few examples on AI/ML gone wrong:
 Amazon had an AI recruiting tool which favored men over women for technical jobs The Microsoft chat bot named &amp;ldquo;Tay&amp;rdquo; which turned racist and sexist rather quickly A doctor at the Jupiter Hospital in Florida referred to IBM&amp;rsquo;s AI system for helping recommend cancer treatments as &amp;ldquo;a piece of sh*t&amp;rdquo; Facebook&amp;rsquo;s AI got someone arrested for incorrectly translating text  The list of AI failures goes on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My GrayHat Red Team Village talk &amp;ldquo;Learning by doing: Building and breaking a machine learning system&amp;rdquo; is now live on YouTube.
Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SV80sIBhqY and smash the Like button! :D

Question? I thought of turning the content into a hands-on workshop. Let me know if that would be something that would you would attend? Trying to see if there is interest.

      <description>For GrayHat 2020 I was asked to create a short intro video for my Red Team Village talk &amp;ldquo;Learning by doing: Building and breaking a machine learning system&amp;rdquo;.
So I put my green screen to good use and recorded this short clip for Red Team Village.
Here is the link to the clip on Twitter:

Hope you like it. :)
The talk will be October, 31st 2020.

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.
When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.
So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

      <description>Excited to announce that I will be presenting at Grayhat - Red Team Village on October 31st 2020. The presentation is about my machine learning journey and how to build and break a machine learning system.
If you follow my blog, you can guess that there will be lots of discussion around &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo;. The bits and pieces that make up a machine learning pipeline, and how to threat model such a system.</description>

      <description>This year one of my goals was to learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I wrote about my journey before - including what classes I took and books I read, the models and systems I built and operationalized, threat modeling it to learn about practical attacks and defenses. My goal is to be knowledge enough in the AI/ML space enough to be able to help bridge the gap between research and operational red teaming - by doing practical things with life systems.</description>

      <description>This year I have spent a lot of time studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good and useful attacks during operations, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.

      <description>These days business decisions and feature development often is influenced heavily by telemetry information. Telemetry is baked into the programs, services and applications we use.
Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.
Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>
