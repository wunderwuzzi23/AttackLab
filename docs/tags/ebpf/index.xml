      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to learn about BPF to understand attacks and defenses. Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all relevant posts.
In the previous posts I spend time learning about bpftrace which is quite powerful. This post is focused on basics and using existing BPF tools, rather then building new BPF programs from scratch.
Living off the land: bpfcc-tools Performance and observability teams are pushing for BPF tooling to be present in production.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to learn how BPFs use will impact offensive security, malware and detection engineering.

In the last few posts, we talked about a bpftrace and how attackers can use it to their advantage. This post is about my initial ideas and strategies to detecting malicious usage.
Detecting BPF misuse There are a set of detection ideas for Blue Teams.</description>

In the last post we talked about a basic bpftrace script to install a BPF program that runs commands upon connecting from a specific IP with a specific magic source port.
This post will dive into this idea more by leveraging more a complex solution.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m learning BPF to understand how its use will impact offensive security, malware, and detection engineering.
One offsec idea that quickly comes to mind with BPF is to observe network traffic and act upon specific events. So, I wanted to see if/how bpftrace, a popular tool for running BPF programs, can be used to create potential backdoors, and what evidence to look for as defenders.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years eBPF has gained a lot of traction in the Linux community and beyond.
eBPF&amp;rsquo;s offensive usage is also slowly getting more attention. So, I decided to dive into the topic from a red teaming point of view to learn about it to raise awareness and share the journey.
Similar to the format of my Machine Learning Attack Series, there will be a serious of posts around BPF usage in offensive settings, and also how its misuse can be detected.</description>
