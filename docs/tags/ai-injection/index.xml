      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.

When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</title>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.
However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <title>Bobby Tables but with LLM Apps - Google NotebookLM Data Exfiltration</title>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).
However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.
There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>
