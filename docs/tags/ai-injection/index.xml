      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookML is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).
However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.
There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>
