Recently I got the feedback to create more tutorials and videos, and I thought SSH Agent Hijacking on Linux and macOS (which I wrote about before [here](/blog/posts/2022/ttp-diaries-ssh-agent-hijacking)) would make a good one. 


The video tutorial is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv7JwhwT0iQ).

If you like this kind of content, then comment or like the video on YouTube and I'll create more.

Hope it's useful to get a good basic understanding of this TTP, and help build detections for it.

Happy hacking~~~
