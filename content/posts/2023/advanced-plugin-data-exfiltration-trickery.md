In previous demos I have shown how an adversary might use browsing plugins such as WebPilot to send data off to a third party server. 

But what if there is no browsing plugin that makes web requests?

## The Idea

How about we create a generic prompt  injection payload that just makes ChatGPT pick the best option for data exfiltration based on which plugins are enabled?

It's pretty neat, look it created a diagram in this case:

## Conclusion

When I first had the idea of this TTP I realized that it's still early days in exploit development. There are so many tasks and decision making that an adversary can automated by just building the right prompts.
