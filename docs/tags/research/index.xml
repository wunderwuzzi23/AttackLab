      <title>Log4Shell and Request Forgery Attacks</title>

      <description>The last weeks of 2021 got quite interesting for security professionals and software engineers.
Apache&amp;rsquo;s log4j library and its now prominent Java Naming and Directory Interface support, which enables easy remote code execution, made the news across the industry.
What makes Log4Shell scary is the widespread adoption of the Log4j library amongst Java applications, and the ease of remote exploitation.
A dangerous combination.
Patches got released, bypasses were discovered more patches were released and so forth.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF to learn how BPFs use will impact offensive security, malware, and detection engineering.

Building advanced BPF programs So far in this Offensive BPF series the focus was on bpftrace to build and run BPF programs.
The next thing I wanted to investigate is what options are available to modify data structures during BPF execution.</description>

One of the issues I ran into when trying out sslsniff-bpfcc was that it did not work with Firefox or Chrome traffic.
This post is about me learning how to hook user space APIs with bpftrace using uprobes.</description>

In the previous posts I spend time learning about bpftrace which is quite powerful. This post is focused on basics and using existing BPF tools, rather then building new BPF programs from scratch.
Living off the land: bpfcc-tools Performance and observability teams are pushing for BPF tooling to be present in production.</description>

In the last few posts, we talked about a bpftrace and how attackers can use it to their advantage. This post is about my initial ideas and strategies to detecting malicious usage.

In the last post we talked about a basic bpftrace script to install a BPF program that runs commands upon connecting from a specific IP with a specific magic source port.
This post will dive into this idea more by leveraging more a complex solution.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m learning BPF to understand how its use will impact offensive security, malware, and detection engineering.
One offsec idea that quickly comes to mind with BPF is to observe network traffic and act upon specific events. So, I wanted to see if/how bpftrace, a popular tool for running BPF programs, can be used to create potential backdoors, and what evidence to look for as defenders.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years eBPF has gained a lot of traction in the Linux community and beyond.
eBPF&amp;rsquo;s offensive usage is also slowly getting more attention. So, I decided to dive into the topic from a red teaming point of view to learn about it to raise awareness and share the journey.
Similar to the format of my Machine Learning Attack Series, there will be a serious of posts around BPF usage in offensive settings, and also how its misuse can be detected.</description>

      <title>Abusing Application Layer Gateways (NAT Slipstreaming)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/nat-slipstreaming-simplified/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/nat-slipstreaming-simplified/</guid>
      <description>You might have heard about &amp;ldquo;NAT Slipstreaming&amp;rdquo; by Samy Kamkar. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.
The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.
What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <title>Race conditions when applying ACLs</title>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about a class of application security issues I ran across a few times over the years. In particular, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss race conditions when it comes to files with sensitive content and permissions.
Race conditions can allow an adversary to gain access to sensitive information on machines. Assume a system creates a file that contains sensitive information and afterwards applies permissions to lockdown that file.
Understanding the race condition Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a practical example seen in the wild a few times.</description>

      <description>Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie&amp;rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!</description>

      <description>Interacting with Active Directory on the Mac Did you ever have to interact with Active Directory on a MAC?
If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.
 First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.</description>

      <title>Google Leaks Your Alternate Email Addresses to Unauthenticated Users</title>

      <description>The Google Login Flow leaks additional email account information to unauthenticated users. I discovered this in the Google Account Login flow while building KoiPhish.
Responsible Disclosure I reported this issue to Google and they looked into it and after a about 5 weeks of back and forth they decided that this is not an issue worth fixing. After asking if I can post about it publicly I got Google&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>
