      <description>This week was HackSpaceCon 2024. It was the first time I attended and it was fantastic.
The conference was at the Kennedy Space Center! Yes, right there and the swag and talks matched the world class location.
The keynote &amp;ldquo;Buckle up! Let&amp;rsquo;s make the world a safer place&amp;rdquo; was by Dave Kennedy, who provided great insights on attacker strategies of the past and present, the importance of active threat hunting and challenges ahead.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we talked about how developers can&amp;rsquo;t intrinsically trust LLM responses and common threats that AI Chatbots face and how attackers can exploit them, including ways to exfiltrate data.
One of the threats is unfurling of hyperlinks, which can lead to data exfiltration and is something often seen in Chatbots. So, let&amp;rsquo;s shine more light on it, including practical guidance on how to mitigate it with the example of Slack Apps.</description>

      <title>Who Am I? Conditional Prompt Injection Attacks with Microsoft Copilot</title>

      <description>Building reliable prompt injection payloads is challenging at times. It&amp;rsquo;s this new world with large language model (LLM) applications that can be instructed with natural language and they mostly follow instructions&amp;hellip; but not always.
Attackers have the same challenges around prompt engineering as normal users.
Prompt Injection Exploit Development Attacks always get better over time. And as more features are being added to LLM applications, the degrees of freedom for attackers increases as well.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT: Lack of Isolation between Code Interpreter sessions of GPTs</title>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.
This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago hidden prompt injections were discovered and we covered it at the time.
This video explains it in more detail, and also highlights implications beyond hiding instructions, including what I call ASCII Smuggling. This is the usage of Unicode Tags Block characters to both craft and deciper hidden messages in plain sight.

      <title>Hidden Prompt Injections with Anthropic Claude</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago while waiting at the airport lounge I was wondering how other Chatbots, besides ChatGPT, handle hidden Unicode Tags code points.
A quick reminder: Unicode Tags code points are invisible in UI elements, but ChatGPT was able to interpret them and follow hidden instructions. Riley Goodside discovered it.
What about Anthropic Claude? While waiting for a flight I figured to look at Anthropic Claude. Turns out it has the same issue as ChatGPT had.</description>

      <description>Last November Google had an interesting update to Google Bard. This updated included the ability to solve math equations and draw charts based on data.
What does this mean and why is it interesting?
It means that Google Bard has access to a computer and can run more complex programs, including Python code that plots graphs!
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore this with a simple example.
Drawing Charts with Google Bard The following prompt will create a chart:</description>

      <title>AWS Fixes Data Exfiltration Attack Angle in Amazon Q for Business</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q for Business, and after looking at it I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.
Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem. This post shares further details and how it was fixed.
The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. This allows an adversary who&amp;rsquo;s data makes it into the chat context (e.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/hiding-and-finding-text-with-unicode-tags/</guid>
      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.
The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.
Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.
Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <title>Malicious ChatGPT Agents: How GPTs Can Quietly Grab Your Data (Demo)</title>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.
Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&#39; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.
Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>
