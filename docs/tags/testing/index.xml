      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.

When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</title>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.
However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Adversaries often leverage supply chain attacks to gain footholds. In machine learning model deserialization issues are a significant threat, and detecting them is crucial, as they can lead to arbitrary code execution. We explored this attack with Python Pickle files in the past.
In this post we are covering backdooring the original Keras Husky AI model from the Machine Learning Attack Series, and afterwards we investigate tooling to detect the backdoor.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>
