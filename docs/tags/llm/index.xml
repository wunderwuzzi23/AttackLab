      <description>A couple of weeks ago hidden prompt injections were discovered and we covered it at the time.
This video explains it in more detail, and also highlights implications beyond hiding instructions, including what I call ASCII Smuggling. This is the usage of Unicode Tags Block characters to both craft and deciper hidden messages in plain sight.
   Using Unicode encoding to bypass security features or execute code (XSS, SSRF,.</description>

      <title>Hidden Prompt Injections with Anthropic Claude</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago while waiting at the airport lounge I was wondering how other Chatbots, besides ChatGPT, handle hidden Unicode Tags code points.
A quick reminder: Unicode Tags code points are invisible in UI elements, but ChatGPT was able to interpret them and follow hidden instructions. Riley Goodside discovered it.
What about Anthropic Claude? While waiting for a flight I figured to look at Anthropic Claude. Turns out it has the same issue as ChatGPT had.</description>

      <description>Last November Google had an interesting update to Google Bard. This updated included the ability to solve math equations and draw charts based on data.
What does this mean and why is it interesting?
It means that Google Bard has access to a computer and can run more complex programs, including Python code that plots graphs!
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore this with a simple example.
Drawing Charts with Google Bard The following prompt will create a chart:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q for Business, and after looking at it I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.
Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem. This post shares further details and how it was fixed.
The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. This allows an adversary who&amp;rsquo;s data makes it into the chat context (e.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.
The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.
Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.
Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <title>Malicious ChatGPT Agents: How GPTs Can Quietly Grab Your Data (Demo)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/openai-custom-malware-gpt/</link>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.
Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&#39; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.
Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>
