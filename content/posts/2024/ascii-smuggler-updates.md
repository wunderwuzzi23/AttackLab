I added a couple of features and improvements to `ASCII Smuggler`, including:

* Optional rendering of the `BEGIN` and `END` Unicode Tags when crafting hidden text
* Added a feature to URL decode the input before checking for hidden text
* Output Modes for Decoding: Switch between highlighting the hidden text amongst the regular content, or only showing the hidden text in the output
* The selected options are remembered now (using local storage)
* Updated the UI to make it look nicer (e.g bigger fonts), and it works better on mobile now

The tool is [here](/blog/ascii-smuggler.html).

Happy hacking.
