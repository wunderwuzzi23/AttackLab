      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.
Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.
This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.
This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:
 Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt.  Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.
Google Colab AI - Revealing the System Prompt At the end of November last year, I noticed that there was a &amp;ldquo;Colab AI&amp;rdquo; feature, which integrated an LLM to chat with and write code.</description>

      <description>This post highlights how the GitHub Copilot Chat VS Code Extension was vulnerable to data exfiltration via prompt injection when analyzing untrusted source code.
GitHub Copilot Chat GitHub Copilot Chat is a VS Code Extension that allows a user to chat with source code, refactor code, get info about terminal output, or general help about VS Code, and things along those lines.
It does so by sending source code, along with the user&amp;rsquo;s questions to a large language model (LLM).</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/google-notebook-ml-data-exfiltration/</guid>
      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).
However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.
There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we talked about how developers can&amp;rsquo;t intrinsically trust LLM responses and common threats that AI Chatbots face and how attackers can exploit them, including ways to exfiltrate data.
One of the threats is unfurling of hyperlinks, which can lead to data exfiltration and is something often seen in Chatbots. So, let&amp;rsquo;s shine more light on it, including practical guidance on how to mitigate it with the example of Slack Apps.</description>

      <description>OpenAI seems to have implemented some mitigation steps for a well-known data exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT. Attackers can use image markdown rendering during prompt injection attacks to send data to third party servers without the users&#39; consent.
The fix is not perfect, but a step into the right direction. In this post I share what I figured out so far about the fix after looking at it briefly this morning.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.
Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&#39; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.
Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/</guid>
      <description>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.
So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!
This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.
I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</description>

      <description>Large Language Model (LLM) applications and chatbots are quite commonly vulnerable to data exfiltration. In particular data exfiltration via Image Markdown Injection is quite frequent.
Microsoft fixed such a vulnerability in Bing Chat, Anthropic fixed it in Claude, and ChatGPT has a known vulnerability as Open AI &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo; the issue.
This post describes a variant in the Azure AI Playground and how Microsoft fixed it.
From Untrusted Data to Data Exfiltration When untrusted data makes it into the LLM prompt context it can instruct the model to inject an image markdown element.</description>

      <description>During an Indirect Prompt Injection Attack an adversary can exfiltrate chat data from a user by instructing ChatGPT to render images and append information to the URL (Image Markdown Injection), or by tricking a user to click a hyperlink.
Sending large amounts of data to a third party server via URLs might seem inconvenient or limiting&amp;hellip;
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want something more, aehm, powerful, elegant and exciting.
ChatGPT Plugins and Exfiltration Limitations Plugins are an extension mechanism with little security oversight or enforced review process.</description>

      <description>This video highlights the various data exfiltration vulnerabilities I discovered and responsibly disclosed to Microsoft, Anthropic, ChatGPT and Plugin Developers.
It also briefly discusses mitigations various vendors put in place (and triage decisions).
   Thanks to MSRC, Anthropic and Zapier for addressing vulnerabilities to help protect their users.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it inspires OpenAI to mitigate the image markdown injection issue finally as well. It&amp;rsquo;s rated as a CVSS High scored vulnerability basically and was first reported to them on April, 9th 2023 - the triage decision was &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This post describes how I found a Prompt Injection attack angle in Bing Chat that allowed malicious text on a webpage (like a user comment or an advertisement) to exfiltrate data.
The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection When Bing Chat returns text it can return markdown elements, which the client will render as HTML. This includes the feature to include images.
Imagine the LLM returns the following text:

Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.
The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.
Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.
However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>
