I put up a [25 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7OX58nHPb8) that covers the fundamentals of `Web Application Security`. 

The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as `HTML`, `HTTP`, `JavaScript` and `Cookies`! 

Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the `Same-Origin Policy` are discussed in detail to provide the foundation to understand the web app security vulnerabilities that will be covered in this series

I presentatied content like this to thousands of engineers at large organiztions and cloud providers in the past, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.

Happy learning and happy hacking!
