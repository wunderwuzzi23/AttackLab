      <description>I did a fun presentation at Black Hat Europe. The talk was titled: &amp;ldquo;SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits&amp;rdquo;. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.
However, there is one part of the presentation that I want to highlight, because it&amp;rsquo;s novel.
A Command and Control system entirely based on prompt injection exploiting ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.
It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.

Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>
