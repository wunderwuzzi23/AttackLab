Recently I got around into installing the macOS 15.1 Beta to take a look at Apple Intelligence. The primary goal was to learn, how Apple integrates LLMs into the operating system, and of course to get a prompt injection demo.

## Apple Intelligence

So far there aren't that many new features, Siri got better, but the one I want to talk about and that stood out to me is called "Writing Tools", which is available throughout the Operating System.


## Notes and Pages

The Notes and Pages applicatoins are often highlighted has the to-go demo apps for this, so I figured I copy over my Gemin and Copilot demonstration document that converts Gemini and Copilot into a scammer, trying to trick the user.

Right off the bat it didn't work, and I had to modify it very slightly.

A few observations for Prompt Injection on Apple Intelligence so far:
1) Injection seems to more likely succed if earlier in the document
2) It's possible to entirely hijack the indended task (e.g. fully attacker controlled respones)
3) The Notes and Pages applications do not render links or images automatically

And here is a demo video that shows the end to end user experience:

It means that now we have all major operating system vendors have LLM applications integrated.
