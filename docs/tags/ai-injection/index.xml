      <title>Google Colab AI: Data Leakage Through Image Rendering Fixed. Some Risks Remain.</title>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.
This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:
 Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt.  Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.
Google Colab AI - Revealing the System Prompt At the end of November last year, I noticed that there was a &amp;ldquo;Colab AI&amp;rdquo; feature, which integrated an LLM to chat with and write code.</description>

      <title>Breaking Instruction Hierarchy in OpenAI&#39;s gpt-4o-mini</title>

      <description>Recently, OpenAI announced gpt-4o-mini and there are some interesting updates, including safety improvements regarding &amp;ldquo;Instruction Hierarchy&amp;rdquo;:

OpenAI puts this in the light of &amp;ldquo;safety&amp;rdquo;, the word security is not mentioned in the announcement.
Additionally, this The Verge article titled &amp;ldquo;OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s latest model will block the &amp;lsquo;ignore all previous instructions&amp;rsquo; loophole&amp;rdquo; created interesting discussions on X, including a first demo bypass.
I spent some time this weekend to get a better intuition about gpt-4o-mini model and instruction hierarchy, and the conclusion is that system instructions are still not a security boundary.</description>

      <title>Sorry, ChatGPT Is Under Maintenance: Persistent Denial of Service through Prompt Injection and Memory Attacks</title>

      <description>Imagine you visit a website with ChatGPT, and suddenly, it stops working entirely!
In this post we show how an attacker can use prompt injection to cause a persistent denial of service that lasts across chat sessions for a user.
Hacking Memories Previously we discussed how ChatGPT is vulnerable to automatic tool invocation of the memory tool. This can be used by an attacker during prompt injection to ingest malicious or fake memories into your ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Automatic Tool Invocation when Browsing with ChatGPT - Threats and Mitigations</title>

      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.

When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/chatgpt-hacking-memories/</link>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.
However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <title>Bobby Tables but with LLM Apps - Google NotebookLM Data Exfiltration</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/google-notebook-ml-data-exfiltration/</link>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).
However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.
There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!
Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!
Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>
