In this 25 minute video I'm explaining the foundations of `Web Application Security`. 

The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as `HTML`, `HTTP`, `JavaScript` and `Cookies`. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the `Same-Origin Policy` are discussed in detail.

The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as `XSS`, `CSRF`, `SQLi`, `tab-nabbing`, etc. later on.

In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.

Happy learning and happy hacking!
