Great news!

An article about `ropci` is in the latest open issue of the Pentest Magazine!

[![pentest magazine](/blog/images/2022/ropci-pentest-magazine.png)](https://pentestmag.com/product/pentest-open-source-pentesting-toolkit/)

The article has a lot more info then my ropci blog post or the info on the [ropci Github repo](https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/ropci). 

Get your copy and check it out! It also has an article about Nuclei, one of my favorite tools.

Cheers.
