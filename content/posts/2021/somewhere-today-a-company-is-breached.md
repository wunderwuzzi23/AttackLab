Somewhere today a company is breached and it does not even know about it.

With regular cadence companies are compromised and suffer breaches. Organizations do not realize a compromise until many days, months, sometimes even years later. 

Well known organizations, like Facebook, Sony, Google, Adobe, Target, LinkedIn, Equifax, SolarWinds (to name a few) faced such unfortunate security events.

> Given enough resources an adversary will always succeed in compromising a target. The question is not so much about the how but the when.

Organizations often are not detecting these breaches themselves but are informed by outside entities. 

## Prevention will fail

One of the challenges someone who wants to build out an offensive security program faces within an organization is the assumption that breaches can be prevented, and that investing in preventive measures is enough to secure the organization.  

That reflects a defensive way to look at security and how to manage and handle risks. Many organizations relized that a new approach is necessary, a new mindset has to be embraced. 

Most organization realize the need for penetration testing, most of the time it comes from compliance requirements. As you might know penetration testing and red teaming are not the same thing. I often see penetration testing as a more short term tactical approach to identify issues in a certain sub-system, and red teaming being a more long term strategic approach to defending your organization.

## The obstacles for red teamers

Red teamers are constantly facing obstacles. Just recently I talked with a security engineer of a large telecommunication provider who must creatively work around issues, because it is only allowed to perform penetration testing during maintenance windows. This severely limits the effectiveness of testing. 

It reminded me of the earlier days in my career facing similar issues when proposing offensive ideas and testing techniques to leadership.

## Embrace the red

In the ned I'd say that the longer your organization does not have a significant security event, the more you should entertain the idea that there might be a large blind spot. That you are not capable of detecting the foothold an adversary might have established already.
