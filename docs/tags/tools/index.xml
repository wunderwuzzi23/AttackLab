      <description>I like using procdump on Windows.
It’s quite handy for software development when systems have memory leaks or performance issues, procdump allows to set thresholds to trigger creation of a core dump.
BUT, it’s also super useful to search processes for secrets and other information.
For instance, this one liner will dump the memory of all processes to hard disk and then you can search them as you see fit.</description>

      <description>In this very short post I wanna talk mention The Silver Searcher, which I just learned about a few weeks ago.
In the past I have written quite a bit about the importance of credential hunting for your organization and some cool built-in operating system indexing features that can be used as well.
Of course grep and findstr are also in every red teamers toolbox.
As part of a coding project I recently learned about &amp;ldquo;The Silver Searcher&amp;rdquo;, which is very fast and has some neat features built it.</description>
